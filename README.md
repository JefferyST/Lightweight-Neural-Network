# Lightweight Neural Network

Now, there are four main directions for lightweight neural network:
1.Manual design of lightweight neural network
2.Automatic design of Neural network based on Neural Architecture Search (NAS)
3.CNN model compression
4.Automatic model compression based on AutoML

This repository introduces some papers for manual design of lightweight neural network.
